GO FISH

Go Fish is an ancient game played by Shaolin Monks in 9th Century Eastern China. It is a game of deception and rigor that tests all those who dare to play it to the limit. It has been said that the greatest challenge for a player is not the other players, but the game and, more importantly, himself.


Each player starts with 5 cards. When it is your turn, ask the other player for a card that will match your cards. The goal is to get ALL FOUR cards in a suit, such as all four KINGS. Once you have all four cards of a suit, you lay them down in front of you. This is known as a BOOK. If the other player does not have the card you ask for, you will be asked to GO FISH, and you will be given a card from the deck. The person with the most books when the deck is gone wins! Fuck Yea! Murica.\n\n"
